I've come to a point where at least in my friend group I'm the python guy. Yet, I never feel like I know all of it because I keep learning new things

### Yield
A little while ago I came across [nvie's fantastic explanation of generators and iterables](http://nvie.com/posts/iterators-vs-generators/). I really hope that he never takes this page down. It introduced me to ```yield```, which I find pretty cool and unique.

### Built-In Libraries
Recently, I've been maintaining an API built for students at college hackathons and let's just say I've never felt I needed unit tests as much as I do now. After stupidly trying to ```pip install unittest``` for a little while I noticed that the documentation for [unittest](https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/unittest.html) for it is on the python built-in libraries page. Within the same context I realized the need for [logging](https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/logging.html), which also happens to be a built-in for python. This has even forced me to read into python library source code since packages like [flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) require a custom logger setup (or perhaps they're following some pattern).

At some point I should probably read the entire documentation for python, or at least the table of contents. Being a language I picked up entirely on my own I seem to only know things relevant to my personal projects.
