title: Learning About HFT

With all the media response to Michael Lewis' new book "Flash Boys", I had to postpone my other books to start reading "Flash Boys" before somebody spoiled it for me. I'm a big fan of Michael Lewis' writing; I've previously read "The Big Short" and "Liar's Poker". I like that even though he writes non-fiction he spends time to develop his characters in his books. Of course, he also does an excellent job explaining things as well. "Flash Boys" explains the practice of high frequency trading (HFT) and how it has changed the landscape of Wall Street literally and figuratively. HFT interests me and it's something I've been following for several years now. This entertaining book shed light on many of my own observations in the market.


HFTs use super fast computers and internet to access ticker symbols, their bid and their offer prices before anyone else. When a stock order isn't fulfilled just in one exchange it gets sent to the other exchanges. HFTs exploit their access to fast information to detect an unfulfilled order and front-runs it in the other exchanges. Front-running is when someone buys up what you order before you and sells it to you for a higher price. What's worse, HFTs create situations for orders to rarely be fulfilled by one exchange so they can front-run trades every time. I admit, as Michael Lewis suspects of most people, I did not know that HFTs were front-running. However, I definitely noticed some odd things happening in the market over the last several years.


I initially grew interested in HFTs as companies like Knight Capital and Hudson River Trading came to recruit software engineers in my University. They pay the most out of all the jobs represented at our career fair. Naturally, I looked them up. I found that they trade electronically using fast programs and mathematical models, but not much else of these companies were obvious. Do they trade quickly in response to news according to financial models? I could not figure out what they do. Then came the the [flash crash](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_Flash_Crash), which further piqued my interest in HFTs and their effect on the market. After some research I learned that micro-crashes had already been happening for sometime. This e shares of Campbell Soup suddenly spike 10 fold and return to normal. At that time I believed the exchange operators explanations.


Something else I noticed, but couldn't explain is the constant presence of 100 share orders on the BATS exchange. I like watching trade tapes because it shows all trades in public markets in real time. It's as if I'm present and watching orders at a real market like a fish market. But when I noticed the trades were for a $4 stock, I knew instantly they were HFTs because the lowest brokerage commission of $5 per trade would put the seller at a 1.23% loss and no institutional manager would adjust their holdings by only $400. My naive guess was that they were measuring the [impulse response](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impulse_response) of the market to model it. A model of the market would allow you to guess its price fluctuation if some large shareholder were to suddenly unload. I now know now thanks to "Flash Boys" that it was merely bait to probe orders so HFTs can front-run trades.


Reading "Flash Boys" has been a rewarding experience, as it completes the puzzle of HFTs and market anomalies for me. For the last few years I slowly found random pieces of the puzzle, but nothing ever brought it all together like reading this book. It answers many mysteries close to home. Furthermore, Michael Lewis does all this through personal stories making this book exciting hard to put down. I can't wait to read the rest of this book. Below I've listed some other entertaining and informative resources I learned from:
