title: About HFT Frontrunning
author: Rentaro

With the enormous media response to the new book "Flash Boys" by Michael Lewis, I had to postpone my other books to start reading "Flash Boys" before I saw too many spoilers. The book explains the practices of high frequency traders (HFT) and how it has changed the landscape of Wallstreet literally and figuratively. So far the book is entertaining and really shines a light on many of the odd things I've seen in the market.

###The Gist
HFTs are carving up mountains and office space to get access to the ticker symbols, their bids and offers before anyone else. When your stock order isn't fulfilled by just one exchange, they would exploit their access to fast information to frontrun you in the other exchanges. Frontrunning is when someone buys up what you order before you and sells it to you for a higher price. What's worse, HFTs create situations for orders to rarely be fulfilled by one exchange so they can frontrun trades everytime. I admit I did not know that HFTs were frontrunning trades. However, I definitely noticed changes in the market. 

###My Exposure to HFT
I initially grew interested in HFTs as companies like Knight Capital and Hudson River Trading came to recruit software engineers in my University. They pay the most out of all the jobs represented at our career fair. Naturally, I looked them up. They trade electronically using fast programs and mathematical models, but not much else of these companies were obvious. Do they quickly in response to news according to financial models? I could not figure out what they do. Then came the the [flash crash](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_Flash_Crash). This further piqued my interest in HFT and their effect on the market. After some research it was clear that microcrashes had already been happening for sometime and exchange operators were blaming it on software glitches and fat-finger traders. Earlier I had seen shares of Campbell Soup suddenly spike 10 fold and return to normal. At that time I believed the exchange operators explanations.

###Bait
Something else I noticed, but couldn't explain is the constant presence of 100 share orders on the BATS exchange. I like watching trade tapes because it shows all trades in public markets in realtime. It's as if I'm present and watching orders at a real market like a fish market. But when I noticed the trades were for a $4 stock, I knew instantly they were HFTs because the lowest brokerage commision of $5 per trade would put the seller at a 1.23% loss and no institutional manager would adjust their holdings by only $400. My naive guess was that they were measuring the [impulse response](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impulse_response) of the market to model it. A model of the market would allow you to guess its price fluctuation if some large shareholder were to suddenly unload. I now know now thanks to "Flash Boys" that it was merely bait to probe orders so HFTs can frontrun trades.

###"Flash Boys" and Other Resources
Reading "Flash Boys" has been a rewarding experience, as it completes the puzzle of HFTs and market anomalies for me. For the last few years I slowly found random pieces of the puzzle, but nothing ever brought it all together like reading this book. It answers many mysteries close to home. Furthermore, Michael Lewis does all this through personal stories making this book exciting hard to put down. I can't wait to read the rest of this book. Below I've listed some other entertaining and informative resources I learned from:
