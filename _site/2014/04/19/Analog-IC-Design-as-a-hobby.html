<h2>Analog IC Design as a Hobby</h2>
<h4>by Rentaro - 19 April 2014</h4>
<p>I may have finally figured out how to tape-out my own analog IC designs without draining my bank account. Although I did poorly in analog IC design at school, I’ve wanted to know what it would take to start a company that designs analog ICs and RFICs. This <a href="http://www.edn.com/electronics-blogs/anablog/4309610/Analog-IC-design-on-the-cheap">super old article</a> on EDN Network is very short and lacks detail, but it essentially shows how CAD software is unneccessary and fabrication can be cheaper using a service like <a href="http://www.mosis.com/">MOSIS</a>.</p>

<p>CAD, or computer aided design, tools usually comes with a simulator and layout tool. The simulator is important because they help engineers simulate complex circuits with some level of accuracy before spending lots of money to fabricate a prototype. The layout tool can check if a design complies with the fabrication equipment’s design rules. CAD can save lots of time and money by eliminating design iterations. After having depended on Cadence in school, a super expensive CAD suite, I didn’t even stop to think that it’s not really a neccessity. The cost for something like what I used in school can run well over millions per year.</p>

<p>After some more digging and thinking I found that LTSpice, a free SPICE simulator I’ve played with, actually can run BSIM3 models. BSIM3 is a highly parametric transistor model sufficiently accurate for analog IC simulation. It’s actually the same model I used in school through Cadence. Simulating my designs would be a matter of finding the model parameters for the fabrication technology. </p>

<p>Once I found the article I did some more digging and found that LTSpice IV, a free circuit simulator</p>
