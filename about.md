##about this site
This site is a aggregation of blogs I migrated from blogger. It houses my project documentation, thoughts, and hobby work. The site should serve as a picture of my mind and as an unofficial portfolio of my personal projects. At the same time, I hope that people like you find the material here instructive or informative. I learn a lot from others' blogs and I believe in reciprocation.

##about me
I am a nerd. I studied engineering at a good University while building electronics, writing software, and trading stocks for fun. Though I've graduated, I still do these things and plan on never stopping.
